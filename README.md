# RBL_for_Android_Studio
Redbearlab Android apps as Android Studio projects

Each folder contains an individual Android Studio project for each of the Redbearlab Apps at https://github.com/RedBearLab/Android/tree/master/Examples

Note that the resulting apps are not identical to the ones distributed by RBL on the Google Play Store. So far, they have not published the up-to-date sources. Also, as far as I can tell, the Chat app does not work. Any updates are appreciated.
